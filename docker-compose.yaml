  # There are multiple way to build a celery worker, 
  # Sometimes it is a good approach to copy all the application of django 
  # so Celery can have access to the application code in case it needes,
  # but it is not always the case
  # Most of the configurations are very similar to the django application.
  # the only difference, I don't run COMMAND, we don't run a server here
  # ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Why I don't need to set ports on another services like redis or celery?
  # Because in django app, I need to access to the app outside of container, 
  # In case of Celery and Redis, as they are in the same Docker environment as 
  # application and they can communicate internally.
